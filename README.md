# Book finder
* A script that finds books on the Glasgow University library resource, takes reviews from Goodreads, and structures it in a database within Django environment.
* After the script is run, the JSON object is formed from the book results and sent to the server.
* Using sorting and/or filtering queries in a url, one can retrieve the books without empty reviews and sorted by number of reviews/best rating.
